This was probably the most enjoyable poker session I experienced so far (well, there weren’t many of them yet). We started five handed, no-limit cash game (the one I hate the most but we always play it live, well, whatever…). While we were starting Joe played both real small stakes nl at our table and was finishing an online sit&amp;go tournament, he managed to get third place and cashed cool $400. For apparent reasons he was kinda excited about it. :)
</p>
<p>
I was involved in two interesting hands (the one when I flopped monster fullhouse wasn’t that interesting really ;-)):
</p>
<p>
In the first one I got A7 of clubs. Nothing interesting before the flop that I remember. We saw flop – me and an agressive opponent (but not maniac, rather reasonable agressive) – containing two clubs, there was a K and something I don’t remember anymore (some not very threatening straight possibility). He bet out and I quickly put him on Kx, and although I thought that my counting of the money in the pot made it rather obvious that I was drawing and counting pot odds, but luckily my opponent didn’t notice. We saw a turn like 9 or something, no clubs. He bet out and again the pot odds were okay for me to call (however I realised that now my flop+turn bets together do not justify the call, but well, it was too late…). River came K again. Well, now he has trip Kings and I am lost with an Ace high. He checked. Uh, does he want to check-raise me on the river? Isn’t it kind of obvious that I missed my draw? Well, I check too and show my missed Ace high draw. And it was good…
</p>
<p>
The second hand was even better – I got KQ, raised, got reraised and called (but not much money yet, just messing around). Flop came QJ4 rainbow… neat, I have top pair with good kicker, I am gonna check-raise him. So I check and he bets around the size of a pot. Now I stop down to think – he is an extremely tight player and not particularly agressive either, it could be just a bluff to punish my checking. After some more thinking I decide he has it – either QJ or AQ. I show my top pair king kicker and he, surprise, surprise… shows AQ. I would be drawing to three outs, hopeless… Needless to say, I was (and still am) very happy about my laydown.

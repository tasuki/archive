First, I’m fully aware of the fact that my blog is public. I don’t mind people reading it, I even want people to read my blog – actually that’s mostly why I write it.
</p>
<p>
Why, then, is it so uncomfortable when people who sit <em>right next to me</em> are reading it? It’s not like I’d mind them reading it somewhere else, but them reading it when I’m nearby makes me feel really awkward.
</p>
<p>
I was thinking about this a lot, but couldn’t really come up with any reason. Maybe I’m scared of the possibility of immediate, real time confrontation? But there wasn’t anything much controversial on the front page at the time. Plus I’m generally not afraid of real time confrontation, as long as it’s either written or in person (I hate telephones).
</p>
<p>
So, to answer the question of how to read my blog: Please, don’t read my blog when I’m nearby. Go to the other room. Thank you.

        <p><p>So you also know why I hate it when people look at my display when I am chatting :D. Or why I have this anxiuos feeling when strong player is watching my game (or even worser … watches me try tsumego).</p>

        <p><p>I generally switch windows when someone is watching me chatting. I really hate it and I exactly know why – it’s a violation of my privacy.</p>

<p>I don’t mind people watching my games (the game is more important than the people at the moment).</p>

<p>People watching me being unable to solve a tsumego can be embarrassing (though not that much, because I tend not to say anything if I’m not sure about the solution and there are people watching – I simply keep reading until I get it. So the only thing they can laugh about is my slow speed… usually not very funny for them…)</p>

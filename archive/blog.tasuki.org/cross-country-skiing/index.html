I’ve just returned from a four day cross-country skiing trip. It was great.
</p>
<p>
Although the snow was rather wet (temperatures above zero all the the time), the weather was nice and I hope we all had a good time (I did). We played various (mostly silly but funny) games, we talked <em>a lot</em> (there were some people with whom I haven’t talked for quite a while), and we were generally just having fun not having to do anything.
</p>
<p>
I was also happy to find out that I’m still able to survive a few days without the internet (actually I don’t miss it, it’s just a bit overwhelming to be back online and have dozens of people trying to talk to me).
</p>
<p>
Now I’m seriously tired and heading to bed… No, I’m not tired from skiing, I’m tired from talking to 3-4am (usually about religious or other quite difficult topics) and then getting woken up early (ie. before noon) by a guy who went to sleep before midnight (every day). Good night…
</p>
<p>
PS: Photos hopefully coming soon.

Here it is, in my very own room. :)
</p>
<p>
It’s a floor goban made of the highest quality wood known as kaya. The stones are made of slate and shells.
</p>
<p>
It cost 10 000€, which I find quite expensive, might as well be the best goban in the whole Europe. Now I should say that it is not mine, it belongs to “Moravian go players” and it is in my room only temporarily (so if you plan on stealing it you will have to hurry (and I have to warn you that it is damn heavy)).
</p>
<p>
I fell in love with it instantly, it’s most delightful to play on it (or replay and study games), the sound of stones being put on the surface is gentle, not the usual awful cracky one you experience with thin and hard gobans.

    <p>I’ve not only stopped writing things on the blog, I also stopped updating its various workings, styles, etc. Time to change the latter, and see if it leads to the former. Knowing life, it probably won’t.</p>

<h3 id="why-not-wordpress">Why not WordPress?</h3>

<p>WordPress has served me well since 2006. 15 years? Not bad – there are few things with this longevity in my computers. But I’ve grown afraid of it:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The interface keeps changing. I’m old and don’t like it when interfaces improve.</li>
  <li>Everything is stored in MySQL. Fine, I can take a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mysqldump</code> every now and then? But what can I do with it really? And I have to actually keep running a MySQL server! If WordPress were able to use SQLite, I might’ve stuck with it.</li>
  <li>PHP, WordPress… guess how often I updated them? Yes – how didn’t everything get hacked yet?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="why-jekyll">Why Jekyll?</h3>

<p>I like versioning things with git. I like simplicity. I like plain text files I can just edit. Digital restraint or hipsterism?</p>

<p>I’ve used Middleman in the past, and now can’t update my <a href="../../tsumego.tasuki.org/index.html">tsumego website</a>. Apparently my Ruby is too new for my dependencies, so I update the dependencies, and then run into <a href="https://github.com/erikhuda/thor/issues/721">a Thor issue</a>, which also is tracked on <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=955405">Debian</a> and <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ruby-thor/+bug/1885424">Ubuntu</a>, and I really don’t care about any of this and just want things to work. Jekyll seems to continue working. I hope it continues working for the next 10 years at least. And if it breaks, I’ve got everything in relatively plain html/markdown files and should be able to take it from there.</p>

<h3 id="comments">Comments</h3>

<p>Your wonderful comments were often much more interesting than my posts, and I worked hard to preserve them. Unfortunately, I’m not sure how to make commenting possible without suck. Some options:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Disqus, Facebook, etc: yes it’s easy, but where is the simplicity? I wanted <em>more</em> control and predictability and safe feelings, using a centralized third party to handle your precious comments would be downright irresponsible.</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/resources/">Jekyll resources</a> page lists some options that allow commenting using GitHub issues: I quite like that a  bit, but the end result looks dodgy – each commenter has to agree to give some random app the write access to their soul.</li>
  <li>The poor-man solution. As this is mirrored on GitHub anyway, just go and create a PR to add a comment? It’s not exactly user friendly, but hey, at least there’s a barrier to entry. I’ve <a href="../comment/index.html">written down instructions how to add comments</a>. If GitHub ever goes away, the comments will be part of the repo and I can take them elsewhere. That, plus no one comments here anymore anyway.</li>
</ol>

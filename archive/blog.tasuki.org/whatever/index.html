Such an amazing word! It can be used to express a myriad of different meanings, but they all have something in common – indifference. “<strong>Whatever</strong>” is possibly the most indifferent word in the world.
</p>
<p>
I’ve been searching for a Czech equivalent, but there simply isn’t anything similar. When you are asked whether you want chocolate or vanilla ice cream, you can say “I don’t care”, but saying “whatever” is way cooler. Unfortunately, in Czech language, we are stuck with “I don’t care”.

        <p><p>I’m fond of the phrase ‘couldn’t care less’. It’s so… extreme. And not as common as ‘whatever’.</p>

        <p><p>Well, it’s a bit over the top… you probably can’t say that to your boss or parents. ^^</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>And by the way, half the time I read that phrase it’s miswritten as “I could care less” – which reverses the actual meaning completely and shows the person has no idea what he/she is saying. It drives me totally mad. &gt;:-</td>

        <p><p>Hm, I think replying “…WHATEVER!” to a request from your boss or your parents is also… controversial :-) (For extra effect, stress the first syllable, and say everything with a typical American accent: “WHAT—EVER!”, like teenagers on cheesy TV-shows do). It’s actually a very negative and rude word, which is probably why it’s so popular.</p>

<p>Btw. I’ve seen this awful bastardization: “whatev” in a few places.</p>

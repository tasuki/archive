I recently found a website called <a  href="http://www.crimelibrary.com/">crime library</a>. The stories there are very very disturbing. They are in fact so disturbing that I suggest you not to read it before going to sleep (or not to read it at all if you just don’t feel like it).
</p>
<p>
I will list a few stories that are particularly frightening… like <a  href="http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/unsolved/btk/btk_jump_page.html">Dennis Rader aka BTK</a>, meaning bind torture kill; <a  href="http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/notorious/bundy/index_1.html">Ted Bundy</a>, a well-educated and seemingly normal guy; <a  href="http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/notorious/fish/index.html">Albert Fish</a>, elderly man who was fascinated by eating humans; <a  href="http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers%5Cpredators%5Cwilder%5Cindex.html">Christopher Wilder</a>, beauty queen killer; or <a  href="http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/notorious/pedro_lopez/1.html">Pedro Lopez</a>, who killed hundreds of young girls. There were also couples that tortured and murdered together, like <a  href="http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/weird/west/index_1.html">Fred &amp; Rose West</a> or <a  href="http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/notorious/bernardo/index_1.html">Paul Bernardo &amp; Karla Homolka</a>. Then there is a particularly disgusting <a  href="http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/notorious/necrophiles/index_1.html">story about necrophiles</a> (if they don’t kill anyone I don’t think there’s anything ethically bad their actions, it’s just disgusting, but the ones mentioned usually killed).
</p>
<p>
One particularly weird story is about <a  href="http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/notorious/necrophiles/index_1.html">Issei Sagawa</a>, who has killed and eaten a woman and is proud of it. Oh yeah, and wasn’t imprisoned… he still walks freely and enjoys a celebrity status in Japan…
</p>
<p>
Also, I never knew that there was a <a  href="http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/famous/bell/index_1.html">10 year old girl</a>, who killed other kids because she enjoyed it. That’s probably the scariest of all the articles. The violence in this one is relatively low, but the fact that it was all done by a 10 year old makes it particularly horrifying.
</p>
<p>
How? How is it possible that human mind can get twisted like that? Can they even be considered humans?

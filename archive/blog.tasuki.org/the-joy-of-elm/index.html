<a href="https://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a> is a purely functional programming language for creating web frontend. It is strongly typed, largely influenced by Haskell – without some of the things that make Haskell difficult for newcomers, and with much better error messages.
</p>
<p>
I’ve recently written two small (~2k lines total) side projects in Elm. Writing code in Elm is an absolute joy:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
It’s <a href="https://guide.elm-lang.org/">easy to get started</a> and Elm is a simple language.
</li>
<li>
Very strong typing – seems somewhat stronger than in Haskell. Eg <code>List.head</code> is of type <code>List a -&gt; Maybe a</code> and won’t crash on you in runtime – if the list is empty you get <code>Nothing</code>. If it compiles it usually works.
</li>
<li>
Elm has amazing error messages. They don’t just tell you what’s wrong, they try to explain why that could be and suggest how you could try to fix the error. I have never before encountered errors this helpful.
</li>
<li>
There’s <a href="https://ellie-app.com/">Ellie – a wonderful online environment to play around and share snippets</a>.
</li>
<li>
The <a href="https://elmlang.slack.com/">Elm Slack</a> is the most helpful and responsive community I’ve ever participated in.
</li>
<li>
Refactoring is a breeze – it compiles it works. I’ve never had a refactoring mess up things that worked before.
</li>
<li>
Yes Elm compiles to JavaScript, and I’ve never had to dive into the generated code.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
That said, there are some potential drawbacks:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
No higher kinded polymorphism: to map over a <code>List</code>, you need to use <code>List.map</code>, to map over <code>Set</code>, use <code>Set.map</code>. This is slightly verbose and sucks for the library developers, but isn’t a big problem for the end user.
</li>
<li>
Elm-land is an autocracy. Evan has been a very enlightened ruler, so this could also be seen as a benefit.
</li>
<li>
The development of Elm itself is intentionally slow: they try to get it right rather than get it out quick. Some things one would like in the standard library are external libraries. The <a href="https://package.elm-lang.org/">repository of Elm packages</a> is rather comprehensive.
</li>
</ul>

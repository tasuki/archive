I’ve been to <a  href="http://www.otaku.cz/">Animefest</a> the other day. It wasn’t nearly as great as the <a  href="../bikerideanimefest/index.html">last year’s one</a> but I still enjoyed it. Here are my impressions:
</p>
<p>
<a  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otaku_no_video">Otaku no Video</a> – parody of otaku (fanatic manga/anime fans), quite funny. I’ve already seen something similar and find it a bit surprising (in a good way) that these are popular.<br />
Cosplay competition – people dress up as anime characters, some of them were really good.
</p>
<p>
<a  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claymore_%28manga%29">Claymore</a> – set in medieval times, half-demons fight against demons. Although this description might sound lame, I think it was very nicely done and there were some touching moments too.
</p>
<p>
<a  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seirei_no_moribito">Seirei no Moribito</a> was probably my favorite one this year. It’s a fantasy adventure about a prince who is protected by a female warrior against bad guys who want to kill him (in fact these bad guys are not evil, they think they will help him by killing him – it’s complicated). I really liked the graphics and the overall atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
<a  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyo_no_Go_no_Ni">Kyo no Go no Ni</a> – a school comedy. I bet that you can figure the rest out by yourself. :-)

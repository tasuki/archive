Today it returned, after more than half a year without problems. I noticed several symptoms and it freaked me like hell.
</p>
<p>
For those of you who do not know, <a  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury">RSI</a> is Repetitive Strain Injury, it is usually caused by sitting by the comp 15 hours a day ;-).
</p>
<p>
I first learnt about it a year ago or so, and in the beginning of the summer I noticed that I have several of symptoms (mostly uneasy feeling in fingers, but sometimes also in arms). Luckily we went to Corsica then and all got okay. Then I almost forgot and only remembered today. My mistake (apart from sitting by the comp all the time) was that I didn’t keep my fingers warm which is not good for ankles. Well, some hot water and ten minutes rest and all seems okay, but I am still freaked and I am afraid to take mouse in my hand (as that is much worse than keyboard because it fixes the hand in single position).
</p>
<p>
Well, my point: when you feel tired from the computer, have a rest at least for a while. It helps to have breaks regularly (but not once in five hours as I do ;-)). Well, enough of writing, that only makes it worse. :-)

Google offers several great services, one of them is <a  href="http://maps.google.com/maps?t=k">google maps</a>. It consists of satelite photos of Earth. You can have a look at where go tournament in Brno takes place – <a  href="http://www.google.com/maps?t=k&hl=en&ll=49.230308,16.518588&spn=0.004463,0.010911&t=k">Santon hotel</a>.
</p>
<p>
I recently stumbled upon <a  href="http://googlesightseeing.com">Google sightseeing</a>, which is a site having links to various interesting things on google maps. Much easier than actually travelling. ;-)

I just read <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html">how to do what you love</a> by Paul Graham. The guy is a genius, really. But I bet that you are too lazy to read it through because it is oh so very long. You will just scroll through it and miss most of his points. Well, too bad for you…
</p>
<p>
And in case I now motivated you to <strong>really</strong> read it and you liked it, you might also like Paul’s <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html">other essays</a>, especially the one about <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/procrastination.html">procrastination</a>.

Thank you people. You all helped me a lot (though some of you might not even know about it while others deeply regret long hours they spent chatting with me having to repeat things over and over ;-)).
</p>
<p>
And I am sorry to all of you I forgot to mention, if you remind me I will happily put your name in the list as well :)
</p>
<p>
I do appreciate your help. Thanks once again.

During my math test I have been thinking about my life (that’s what I do during most of the tests). I was considering possible pluses and minuses of my recent web creating activity and found out that it can’t really end in a failure – the worst scenario being that I will “only” learn some xhtml, php, css, (mysql?), and also a lot about subjects of my sites, this isn’t really a wasted time, is it? And well, then there is always some slight chance of getting some money as well (the first week brought me about half a dollar, so if it continues at this pace I will be a millionaire in just about hundred thousand years…).
</p>
<p>
Oh yeah, and of course I screwed the math test…

What is the meaning of life? What should one do when he loses his meaning of life? How is it possible that someone who likes you suddenly stops? Well, maybe it wasn’t suddenly, but that doesn’t make it any better, just the opposite. What is the correlation between love and sex? Is there any? Why are there so many questions and no answers? I feel down, I really do.

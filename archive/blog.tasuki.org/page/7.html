<strong>The good:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Polish people are extremely hospitable and helpful.
</li>
<li>
Either there is a very low amount of thieves or I am really lucky.
</li>
<li>
Food (cheese, bread, yoghurt, chocolate) in shops is quite a bit cheaper here than in Czechia (though restaurants aren’t cheaper at all).
</li>
<li>
Krakow rocks. Especially the shores of Wisła river next to the Wawel castle.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>The bad:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Car drivers drive like assholes. When you’re going by bike, they drive way closer than what I find comfortable (I thought I was used to this from Czechia, but in Poland it’s even a little worse). When you, as a walker, get to a zebra crossing, in Western Europe the drivers will do everything they can to stop and let you pass. In Czechia, they usually let you pass, but not always (not when they’re going fast and don’t want to halt). In Poland, drivers almost never stop at a zebra crossing. You can see them slowing down, so you step into the street thinking “finally a decent driver” and the next thing you know is that you are jumping back onto the pavement as the driver was just slowing down to take a right turn. Similar on red lights – just because there’s red lights shining 50 meters ahead of the passing car doesn’t mean that the driver will let you pass.
</li>
<li>
No discounts for lunch menu in restaurants. Eating out is quite expensive compared to cooking yourself.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Yeah, both lists are incomplete. Does it look like I post this just because I haven’t posted anything in April yet?

I was thoroughly bored with the <a href="https://blog.tasuki.org/index.php?wptheme=Silhouette">previous theme</a>, and although I tried to revive it with the new header image, it was still bugging me. So I created <a href="https://blog.tasuki.org/index.php?wptheme=SimpleTypo">a new one</a>.
</p>
<p>
I had a draft of a new theme lying around for quite a long time, so I made few adjustments to it: made the code much longer and much less clean. But it seems to work.
</p>
<p>
Features of the new design include, but are not limited to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
big letters in headings (big letters rock)
</li>
<li>
even less images (none, except the two links to flickriver, smilies and images in posts)
</li>
<li>
half-fixed-width half-fluid design (the design is fixed width, but the sidebar is fluid – works well for many different widths of browser (800px – the sidebar isn’t displayed, it’s accessible through scrolling; 1024px – sidebar in one column, 1280px – two columns, more px – more columns (it is capped at three columns)))
</li>
<li>
emphasis on typography (lists, blockquotes, etc. are styled properly)
</li>
<li>
lines vertically in synch (left column, middle column and sidebar)
</li>
<li>
the old color scheme, I mostly like it and more importantly – couldn’t find a better one at the moment :)
</li>
<li>
justified text (I’m still very unsure here – justified looks way better, but left-aligned is more readable)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Bugs of the new design include, but are not limited to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
IE6 sometimes messes up the sidebar, not quite sure why
</li>
<li>
Opera doesn’t keep lines in synch when there are smileys (and I thought I had the solution, sigh…)
</li>
<li>
IE doesn’t align the comment date in the comment list (will look into that later)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Also, I spent ages dealing with various bugs in IE that caused things to disappear.<br />
One such bug caused the sidebar not to appear (it was an absolutely positioned element next to a floated element – don’t ever do that), another sometimes caused titles to disappear (they were relatively positioned, now that they are static it seems ok, but I have no idea why). When repairing the sidebar, I had to move it in front of the actual content in the markup, which is wrong and I know it. I am sorry to all lynx/links users out there.
</p>
<p>
Bug reports, remarks and suggestions are welcome! ;-)

Almost everyone, myself included, underestimates the basics.
</p>
<p>
If you want to be an expert in any field, you need very strong basics. When you don’t know the basics, you tend to make many mistakes which are hard to get rid of. We are ambitious so we dive deep into all sorts of advanced stuff, leaving the basics for later, perhaps thinking we will somehow figure the basics out along the way. This sometimes works, but more often it doesn’t.

<p>
So, back to the basics for me! (in what, you ask? – in everything!)

    <p>
I first read Desiderata in Polish, at Letnia Szkoła Go. There’s a path that leads through woods. As you walk down, every few dozen of meters you encounter a slab with one verse on it. I found it hard to understand as my Polish wasn’t as great back then, but from what I understood I knew this was something special.
</p>
<p>
I thought it was just local folklore and so was surprised to find out that Desiderata was originally written in English almost one hundred years ago by Max Ehrmann.
</p>
<p>
Desiderata is a short prose poem, possibly the most powerful text I’ve ever read. Everytime I’m feeling down, angry, hurt, upset or desperate it brings instant calmness. Here’s a quote, one of my favourites:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter,<br />
for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.<br />
<em>–Desiderata</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I felt an urgent need to print out Desiderata and cover the walls with it. As I haven’t used TeX for quite a while (a year or more?), this was a good opportunity to recall it a bit. You can download <strong><a href="../assets/2009/desiderata.pdf">Desiderata (pdf)</a></strong> for printing.

  <div class="content">
    <p>
The first time I saw square thumbnails (ie. thumbnails which are downsized and cropped to square) I thought they were the best thing since sliced bread.
</p>
<p>
The advantages of square thumbnails are obvious:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
they are really easy to align and never mess up your layout
</li>
<li>
the layout will look more uniform and better than with irregular thumbnails
</li>
<li>
they do not show everything so they invite the visitor to view the full sized picture
</li>
</ul>
<p>
But there is a downside. Square thumbnails <em>alter</em> the composition of the picture. In some cases, when the photographer hasn’t thought much about composition, it can often actually improve the picture. But in other cases, when the composition is deliberate and well thought out, the square thumbnail can destroy it completely.
</p>
<p>
I use square thumbnails in my <a href="../../gallery.tasuki.org/index.html">photo gallery</a> (have you seen the pictures from my <a href="../../gallery.tasuki.org/2009/01-tri-studne.html">recent cross-country skiing trip</a>?). And I keep wondering whether I should change it to normal thumbnails (normal = scaled down so as to fit into a given rectangle while preserving the aspect ratio).
</p>
<p>
Do you personally prefer photo galleries with square thumbnails (cropped) or with normal ones?

It used to be that I could barely run few hundred meters. The two main problems were that I couldn’t catch my breath and that the side of my stomach started hurting.
</p>
<p>
I started running regularly few months ago in connection with my <a href="../how-to-get-an-extra-hour-a-day/index.html">extra hour a day</a> program. I abandoned early rising – nowadays I just get up at 9 during the weekend feeling completely drained, not to mention Mondays. Changing this to rising early again is definitely on my to-do list. It rocked, and it sucks now.
</p>
<p>
When I was starting, I ran a little over 3.5km at a very slow pace (almost half an hour). After reading few articles about running, I started paying more attention to proper breathing and few other things. I added a longer 6.5km route along the river to add variety to the routine. I found it surprisingly easy to run almost twice as far.
</p>
<p>
And now, feeling pretty comfortable with 6.5km, I connected the two routes to make it over 10 kilometers (I am not sure how far it actually is, but according to google maps it’s something between 10km and a quartermarathon (10.5km)). I ran it in 57 minutes on my first (and so far the only) try. I’ll try again the next weekend, if the weather is any good.
</p>
<p>
Running is good because:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
it is rather demanding and makes you tired quickly (so that you can get back to your beloved computer as soon as possible ;))
</li>
<li>
you need no special equipment and you can run anywhere
</li>
<li>
runner’s high is not a rumour
</li>
<li>
it helps your health in various ways (I used to have half-asthma and after running few hundred meters I couldn’t breathe for another two hours (really), but now I trained my lungs and improved my breathing technique)
</li>
<li>
you have plenty of time to think when running, so you are bound to get various good ideas while running
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Also, running is simply <strong>fun</strong>.

As any economist would tell you, time is money. What people sometimes fail to realise is that it works the other way around just as well: money is time.
</p>
<p>
That is, when you have time, you can work and get money. There are many things you can do with money. Most people just buy things they neither need nor want.

Now, I mostly like my job. :) But this quote is still worth thinking about.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Advertising is the art of convincing people to spend money they don’t have for something they don’t need.<br />

<p>
On a less serious but still related note…

<p>
By the way, if anyone here is in advertising or marketing… kill yourself…you’re the ruiner of all things good… you are Satan’s spawn, filling the world with bile and garbage… kill yourself.<br />

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
So much for quotes. Back to the topic.
</p>
<p>
I live in an abundance of luxury. I have food to eat, a warm and dry place to sleep, and clothes to wear. I’m not willing to submit to pointless consumerism.
</p>
<p>
That said, I am left with some money. I can leave it in the bank waiting for the economical crisis to eat it up. Or I can use it to buy some free time to do what I really want to do…
</p>
<p>
Happy New Year, by the way. :)

I remember thinking about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space">space</a> (as in “three-dimensional extent in which objects and events occur and have relative position and direction”) when I was a little kid. I asked my dad what was outside of the universe and he told me that we do not know for sure but most probably there isn’t <em>anything</em>. I couldn’t quite understand what he meant by that, so I asked him, and he continued to explain that there simply is no space. I couldn’t grasp that either, so I imagined that there is a <em>very hard rock</em> – so hard that nothing else can fit in there, and hence there is no space.
</p>
<p>
I grew older and abandoned the very-hard-rock theory. But I haven’t found a reasonable substitute for it. And it bothers me. A lot.
</p>
<p>
There simply is no reasonable possibility for space to even exist:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Space is infinite and extends everywhere and never ends. I think I do not even need to explain why this sounds stupid.
</li>
<li>
Space is finite. Then what is outside of it? There is no space outside. Then there is no outside. Unreasonable, too.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Please note that I am talking about space, not necessarily in connection with the universe. Just the concept of space and its infinity/finity confuses the hell out of me. And it makes me scared.
</p>
<p>
It’s similar with time. According to wikipedia, universe is the “entirety of space and time”. So, if I understand it correctly, there was no time before universe. And the universe is approximately 13.73 billion years old. Which means that 14 billion years ago, there was no time. Wait, what?

After pondering about it for a long time, I’ve finally decided to sell my soul. Yes, this blog, the place where I share my thoughts and opinions with you, my dear readers, this very blog has become polluted by ads.
</p>
<p>
Now, before you leave for good, here are some quick tips on how to avoid being exposed to ads:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
don’t browse old posts <em>or</em>
</li>
<li>
browse as a registered user <em>or</em>
</li>
<li>
use <a href="http://adblockplus.org/">holy water</a> to protect you from the devil
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Any one of the above mentioned tips will help you stay on the safe side. The third one is the best option, as it will also protect you from the devil on most other websites…

  </h1>
  <div class="meta">
    <span class="date">2008-12-18</span>
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
I started trying to touch type about two months ago. I used <a href="http://klavaro.sourceforge.net/">Klavaro</a> (if you are on linux it’s most probably in your distribution’s repositories) to learn, and I’ve also learned by trying to use the right fingers for typing and not to look at the keyboard whenever typing.
</p>
<p>
My typing speed was promised to increase dramatically in few weeks while practicing a little every day. No such thing happened, although I’ve practiced almost all the time. I still write considerably slower than I did before I started touch typing. Am I unhappy that I started touch typing? Not at all – let me explain:
</p>
<p>
The advantage is that I can just look at the screen while typing. That might seem like a single advantage, but it’s actually several in one.
</p>
<p>
First, I can <em>read other stuff while typing</em> or <em>look at people</em> who are talking to me while I type (I learned that from a colleague, it’s real intimidating).<br />
Second, I don’t have to switch <em>display, keyboard, display, keyboard, display, keyboard</em>… I just look at the display. This is much cooler than it sounds – it enabled me to move the monitor cca 40cm above the keyboard (both home and at work). So I can finally sit straight instead of bending over the keyboard.
</p>
<p>
On a completely unrelated note, I finally switched from czech qwerty (writing !@#%$&amp;^% characters with alt) to standard english keyboard layout. A lot of stuff in vim has become much more comfortable – such as the ; right under my pinky, which means that repeating f/F/t/T has just gotten even easier and better.
</p>
<p>
On a semirelated note, I never knew that to write the capital X you can press the right shift plus the x. It’s not that I thought you couldn’t do that, I just never realised it could be useful and no one ever told me “you are doing it wrong”.

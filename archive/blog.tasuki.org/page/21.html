I used to use tasuki@volny.cz, then got tasuki@seznam.cz for registering to suspicious places that could send me spam, and two years ago or so I switched to vit.brunner@gmail.com. I still forwarded the two previous emails there, as sometimes someone sent me something there, but lately I found out that I am more or less only forwarding spam.
</p>
<p>
Now I recieved about one spam every hour (yeah, I know, it’s still not that bad), so I decided it was the right time to cancel the redirects, so, the old adresses don’t work anymore, use the new one.

There’s no point to this post, just an announcement or something like that.

Do you know <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed">sed</a>? It is a program that transforms text (I’ve used it to transfer sgf to my povray format), however, some people thought it’d be funny to make games in sed…
</p>
<p>
They made classic <a  href="http://sed.sourceforge.net/local/games/pong1player.sed.html">pong</a> game and <a  href="http://sed.sourceforge.net/local/games/sokoban.sed.html">sokoban</a> (the old game where you are a man that has to move boxes through a maze). Well, I think they are completely crazy (both the games and their creators), but I really like the idea of (ab)using sed in this way.
</p>
<p>
Sorry for a geekish post. (but I really do find this interesting :-))

I’ve been living in this room since I was 4 years old or so (I had been in living parents’ room before I think).
</p>
<p>
To the north there is my sister’s room, to the east there is the living room, and garden is south. There is terrace above my room, and bathroom and corridor below. But what is in the west direction?
</p>
<p>
Just as I sit here, I have no idea what exactly there is. Well, there is neighbours’ house, and I think they have a living room there, but I’m not sure. The wall is probably quite thick as I never heard any sounds from there, not even music or so.
</p>
<p>
And why am I writing about it? I find it rather creepy that I have no idea what is there, just one or two meters far. Do you know all the direct surroundings of the place you live in?

I’ve read somewhere that average blog lasts slightly less than three months. <strong>Now</strong> I can see why.
</p>
<p>
I’ve had the blog for about three and a half month, so I am already above average, but lately I simply do not have enough energy to write posts. It’s not that there is nothing to write about, there are plenty of things I’d like to write about, but somehow it is too much work and I am very lazy.
</p>
<p>
So, don’t expect the blog to come to the end now, but maybe I will slow down a bit…

I haven’t made a blog post in quite a while, that’s because I was in Berlin and didn’t have much time.
</p>
<p>
There was a <a  href="http://www.govb.de/govbweb/epgc06/index.html">pair-go championship</a> (two pairs playing against each other, partners alternate in making moves). We finished fifth with Anicka, which is quite nice considering we haven’t played pair-go together yet. Apart from that, it was a nice trip, I saw Berlin (I expected a bit more but I don’t complain), ate some sushi and various different japanese-style food.
</p>
<p>
I also met In-seong Hwang, who studied go (or baduk, as they use to call it in Korean) for five years at Korean <a  href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?MyongjiUniversity">Myongji university</a>. There is a department of baduk at college of arts, it must be totally incredible to study go at university (instead of informatics, for example :-)).

Here it is, in my very own room. :)
</p>
<p>
It’s a floor goban made of the highest quality wood known as kaya. The stones are made of slate and shells.
</p>
<p>
It cost 10 000€, which I find quite expensive, might as well be the best goban in the whole Europe. Now I should say that it is not mine, it belongs to “Moravian go players” and it is in my room only temporarily (so if you plan on stealing it you will have to hurry (and I have to warn you that it is damn heavy)).
</p>
<p>
I fell in love with it instantly, it’s most delightful to play on it (or replay and study games), the sound of stones being put on the surface is gentle, not the usual awful cracky one you experience with thin and hard gobans.

Keo pointed me to a page that has <a  href="http://www.bnl.gov/bnlweb/history/higinbotham.asp">extensive information about first video game</a>. The game was made in 1958 and played on oscilloscope, which I find utterly hilarious (playing videogames is one of the few things I surely wouldn’t use oscilloscope for ;-)).
</p>
<p>
There is also a <a  href="http://real.bnl.gov/ramgen/bnl/pong.rm">2 minute video</a>, which is worth watching even if you are too lazy to read the text (and you <strong>are</strong> too lazy, I know my readership :-)).

Some people think that I “understand computers”, which in their mind somehow implies that I will be able to solve their Micro$hit Windoze (tm) problems (tm). They <span style="font-weight: bold">know</span> that I use linux and that I hate Windows (tm), but that doesn’t stop them from asking me various questions about how to solve their various Windows problems (ranging from networking problems (I only know that ifconfig is called ipconfig in windows and that’s about it), through undeleting their deleted files, to questions about obscure things concerning Word and Excel).
</p>
<p>
It is completely beyond me why they think I will be able to help them (and that I will actually want to :-)). Go and ask Bill Gates, he is responsible for your Windows related problems…

Well, I once posted some optical illusions, and now I found a site that has them all. Yup, pretty much all the optical illusions that are, they are about 60.
</p>
<p>
Humm, it would be probably useless to write more shit<sup>H</sup>H<sup>H</sup>Hstuff here, so I will just send you to the <a  href="http://www.michaelbach.de/ot/">optical illusions page</a>.

As a side note, I feel really exhausted now, not sure why, haven’t done anything tiring today and it is only eleven o’clock…

Many posts have been written on the topic of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=best+free+fonts">best free fonts</a>. Therefore, I’d like to approach it differently.
</p>
<p>
Here, have a picture:
</p>
<p>
<a href="../assets/2008/freetype.png"><img src="https://blog.tasuki.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/freetype-small.png" alt="free typefaces"/></a>
</p>
<p>
You should click on that picture to see the large version. And if your screen isn’t big enough and your browser thinks the image would look better downsized – your browser is wrong: click on the zoom button and view the picture in its original size.
</p>
<p>
As you can see, there are only 14 fonts. Surely there must be more quality fonts available for free? Yes, there are. This is a small selection of only the best of the best.
</p>
<p>
Now that you have the original picture open, let’s have a look at those 14 fonts (all available either in <em>otf</em> or in <em>ttf</em>):
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong><a href="http://nowacki.strefa.pl/torunska-e.html">Antykwa Toruńska</a></strong> is a very original typeface created by Polish type designer Zygfried Gardzielewski in 1960. It was digitised by Janusz Marian Nowacki. The font contains many obscure glyphs (various diacritical marks, math symbols, etc.) and is available in light, regular, medium and bold versions, each of which has its own italics.
</li>
<li>
<strong><a href="http://www.dafont.com/typo-latin-serif.font">Typo Latin Serif</a></strong> is a slab serif (egyptian) typeface with an extremely large x-height. It was created by a German type designer <a href="http://manfred-klein.ina-mar.com/">Manfred Klein</a>.
</li>
<li>
The <strong><a href="http://dejavu.sourceforge.net/">DejaVu fonts</a></strong> are based on the excellent Bitstream Vera typefaces and extended by additional glyphs. They are well hinted so they preserve their onscreen readability even in small sizes.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Palatino</strong> is a typeface by Hermann Zapf, a pioneer of computer typography. Palladio L is a free Palatino clone created by URW in cooperation with Hermann Zapf. You can download it in <a href="http://www.artifex.com/downloads/">URW fonts pack</a> (together with 79 other fonts).
</li>
<li>
<strong><a href="http://www.sil.org/~gaultney/Gentium/">Gentium</a></strong>, a typeface for the nations by Victor Gaultney, extensive unicode support.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Optima</strong> is another wonderful typeface by Hermann Zapf. You can download it as <a href="http://www.ellak.gr/fonts/mgopen/index.en.html">MgOpen Cosmetica</a>.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Bembo</strong> is a dynamic antiqua created by Francesco Griffo in 1496. The font <a href="http://scholarsfonts.net/cardofnt.html">Cardo</a>, based on Bembo typeface, was created by David Perry.
</li>
<li>
<strong><a href="http://www.grafikfritze.de/?p=43">Vollkorn</a></strong> is an old style numerals featuring typeface which was created by Friedrich Althausen. Old style numerals <em>own</em>.
</li>
<li>
<strong><a href="http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/latin-modern">Computer Modern</a></strong> is a Didone typeface created by professor <a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/">Donald Ervin Knuth</a>.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Avant Garde</strong> by Herb Lubalin can be downloaded in the above mentioned <a href="http://www.artifex.com/downloads/">URW font pack</a> where it is known as URW Gothic L.
</li>
<li>
<strong><a href="http://chemoelectric.deviantart.com/art/Goudy-Bookletter-1911-74918469">Goudy Bookletter 1911</a></strong> is a reincarnation of Frederic Goudy’s <em>Kennerley Old Style</em> by Barry Schwartz (funny thing, another Barry Schwartz… there is also Barry Schwartz the SEO and Barry Schwarts the psychologist from <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6127548813950043200">Paradox of choice</a>). By the way, have I mentioned that old style numerals <em>own</em>?
</li>
<li>
<strong>Helvetica</strong> by Max Miedinger. Perhaps the most famous and most abused typeface ever (seriously, fuck Arial). Helvetica isn’t any less awesome now than it was 50 years ago. This version was created by Magenta Ltd. and is available in the MgOpen pack as <a href="http://www.ellak.gr/fonts/mgopen/index.en.html">MgOpen Moderna</a>.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.dafont.com/geo-sans-light.font">Geo Sans Light</a> is a font by Manfred Klein, which is based on <strong>Futura</strong>, a geometric typeface created by Paul Renner in 1926.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Garamond</strong>. The best serif typeface ever. For the third time, <a href="http://www.artifex.com/downloads/">URW font pack</a>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The picture was created with <a href="http://www.inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>. Inkscape rocks. For anything that you think <em>might be vector</em> use Inkscape. Generally, GIMP for photo editing, Inkscape for everything else. It enables very easy manual kerning, and after you are done, you can convert the letters to paths (Bezier), and continue making changes (not sure whether that was clear – anyway go and try it out :)).
</p>
<p>
Ah, I almost forgot – you can get the <a href="../assets/2008/freetype-paths.svg">SVG source file</a> (already converted to paths, as I don’t suppose you have all the fonts installed).
</p>

I recently watched <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schindler%27s_List">Schindler’s List</a> and it was a very intense experience. You can read the movie reviews elsewhere, so I will just share transcripts (shamelessly <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Schindler%27s_List">stolen from wikiquote</a>) of two dialogs that I really liked:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Goeth</strong>: You know, I look at you. I watch you. You’re not a drunk. That’s, that’s real control. Control is power. That’s power.<br />
<strong>Schindler</strong>: Is that why they fear us?<br />
<strong>Goeth</strong>: We have the fucking power to kill, that’s why they fear us.<br />
<strong>Schindler</strong>: They fear us because we have the power to kill arbitrarily. A man commits a crime, he should know better. We have him killed and we feel pretty good about it. Or we kill him ourselves and we feel even better. That’s not power, though, that’s justice. That’s different than power. Power is when we have every justification to kill – and we don’t.<br />
<strong>Goeth</strong>: You think that’s power.<br />
<strong>Schindler</strong>: That’s what the emperors had. A man stole something, he’s brought in before the emperor, he throws himself down on the ground, he begs for mercy, he knows he’s going to die. And the emperor pardons him. This worthless man, he lets him go.<br />
<strong>Goeth</strong>: I think you are drunk.<br />
<strong>Schindler</strong>: That’s power, Amon. That is power. <em>[gestures toward Goeth as a merciful emperor]</em> Amon, the Good.<br />
<strong>Goeth</strong>: <em>[He smiles and laughs]</em> I pardon you.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You can <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wn9rWU1AuIM">watch “control is power” on youtube</a>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Stern</strong>: We’ve received an angry complaint from the Armaments Board. The artillery shells, tank shells, rocket casings, apparently all of them have failed quality-control tests.<br />
<strong>Schindler</strong>: Well, that’s to be expected – start-up problems. This isn’t pots and pans. This is a precise business. I’ll write them a letter.<br />
<strong>Stern</strong>: They’re withholding payment.<br />
<strong>Schindler</strong>: Sure. So would I. So would you. I wouldn’t worry about it. We’ll get it right one of these days.<br />
<strong>Stern</strong>: There’s a rumor you’ve been going around miscalibrating the machines. They could shut us down, send us back to Auschwitz.<br />
<strong>Schindler</strong>: I’ll call around, find out where we can buy shells, pass them off as ours.<br />
<strong>Stern</strong>: I don’t see the difference. Whether they’re made here or somewhere else.<br />
<strong>Schindler</strong>: You don’t see a difference? I see a difference.<br />
<strong>Stern</strong>: You’ll lose a lot of money, that’s the difference.<br />
<strong>Schindler</strong>: Fewer shells will be made. Stern, if this factory ever produces a shell that can actually be fired, I’ll be very unhappy.

    <p>
Imagine you could get an extra hour every day. That means 365 hours a year. 365 hours is like 45 eight-hour work days. <em>Wow.</em>
</p>
<p>
I’ll start with a success story. Over a month ago, I read something very interesting about how to sleep properly. I used to have problems getting out of bed at 7am. I used to have those mornings when I felt like half asleep zombie for several hours after getting up. Now I have no problems waking up at 6:45, sometimes I even wake up earlier without the alarm clock. Oh, and I also started going to bed later (usually shortly after midnight but it really depends on when I start feeling tired).
</p>
<p>
Out of the last 8 days, I went jogging in the early morning 7 times. Today I woke up at 6:42, three minutes before my alarm would go off. It’s Saturday 7:37am and I just came back from my half an hour of jogging. I had a shower and am enjoying my breakfast, while all of you are asleep. ;) These long weekends are amazing – it really is a measurable difference.
</p>
<p>
Here are the keys (more or less sorted by importance):
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>get up at a regular time</strong> (yes, that includes weekends), go to sleep when you get tired (no earlier and no later)
</li>
<li>
<strong>get enough sunshine and natural daylight</strong> during the day (bulbs will not cut it, you need real light)
</li>
<li>
every day, do at least 20 minutes of increased physical activity such as running (most effective in the morning)
</li>
<li>
drink a lot of pure water (it’s also generally good for your health)
</li>
<li>
if you feel like taking a nap after lunch, do so (limit it to 20-30 minutes), naps are good for you
</li>
<li>
never ever take sleeping pills (important, but rather common sense, isn’t it?), don’t drink coffee or overeat yourself before going to sleep
</li>
</ul>
<p>
When I was starting with this I was called gullible. What is worse – I was called gullible by someone who believes in a three-in-one god that is supposedly omnipotent and sent his only son (who was actually one of the three) to save the mankind by dying on a cross in huge pain. <em>Crazy stuff.</em>

It’s funny but I couldn’t find anyone having this issue. It certainly isn’t limited to Zend Framework, it affects everyone who doesn’t have access to apache configuration and wants to have document root in a deeper directory. Maybe I just can’t google very well.
</p>
<p>
Imagine a shared host. You can’t choose your document root, it’s firmly set to one particular directory. Now you want to install <a href="http://framework.zend.com/">Zend Framework</a>. Imagine you’d like to follow the standard directory structure (that means you more or less have these directories in your project: application (the application), library (zend and other libraries) and public (stuff accessible from the outside, images, css etc.)). Normally, you’d want to point your document root to the public directory, but when you can’t do that you can use .htaccess in the project directory to redirect everything to public.
</p>
<p>
<code lang="apache">RewriteEngine On<br />
RewriteRule !.(js|gif|jpg|png|css|txt)$ public/index.php [L]<br />
RewriteRule ^(.<em>)$ public/<span class="math inline">$1 [L]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This was the first thing I wrote, and it works on &lt;strong&gt;certain&lt;/strong&gt; servers. Other servers will kindly remind you that &lt;em&gt;"Request exceeded the limit of 10 internal redirects due to probable configuration error."&lt;/em&gt; Which kind of makes sense when you think about it. Makes me wonder how comes the above code actually worked on two different configurations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now here's the code that works (and in my humble opinion it also &lt;strong&gt;should&lt;/strong&gt; work, as opposed to the one above):&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code lang="apache"&gt;RewriteEngine On&lt;br /&gt; RewriteRule !\.(js|gif|jpg|png|css|txt)$</span> public/index.php [L]<br />
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/public/<br />
RewriteRule ^(.</em>)$ public/$1 [L]</code>

I’ve never really watched any television series. Sure, I saw an episode or two of many various series, but it never quite felt worth spending more time on them. This summer I was shown 4 episodes of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_I_Met_Your_Mother">HIMYM</a>.
</p>
<p>
I tried to resist for a while, because I consider television series to be a waste of time (and time is the most precious for me). But after few weeks I just gave up and started watching the series from the start. And even though I “wasted” about 24 hours of my life, I don’t regret it.
</p>
<p>
Also, my opinion of Tuesdays has increased dramatically since I started watching HIMYM. Today’s episode (S04E05 as they say, or “Shelter Island”, if you prefer the full name) was simply perfect. There was a little bit of everything, silly jokes, profound jokes, back references, sad moments, life lessons, you name it.
</p>
<p>
Happy Tuesday!

Such an amazing word! It can be used to express a myriad of different meanings, but they all have something in common – indifference. “<strong>Whatever</strong>” is possibly the most indifferent word in the world.
</p>
<p>
I’ve been searching for a Czech equivalent, but there simply isn’t anything similar. When you are asked whether you want chocolate or vanilla ice cream, you can say “I don’t care”, but saying “whatever” is way cooler. Unfortunately, in Czech language, we are stuck with “I don’t care”.

First, I’m fully aware of the fact that my blog is public. I don’t mind people reading it, I even want people to read my blog – actually that’s mostly why I write it.
</p>
<p>
Why, then, is it so uncomfortable when people who sit <em>right next to me</em> are reading it? It’s not like I’d mind them reading it somewhere else, but them reading it when I’m nearby makes me feel really awkward.
</p>
<p>
I was thinking about this a lot, but couldn’t really come up with any reason. Maybe I’m scared of the possibility of immediate, real time confrontation? But there wasn’t anything much controversial on the front page at the time. Plus I’m generally not afraid of real time confrontation, as long as it’s either written or in person (I hate telephones).
</p>
<p>
So, to answer the question of how to read my blog: Please, don’t read my blog when I’m nearby. Go to the other room. Thank you.

Yay, I made it – one year without using Brno public transport. I walked, walked, walked and walked. Sometimes I used my bike when it was too far and when the weather was suitable. I only used car when it was because of someone else (such as driving my grandaunt to her home or similar occasions).
</p>
<p>
I had used public transport at Brno tournament one year ago, and now I had to do the same because the tournament site is too far to walk to and I couldn’t go by bike as I was going with my Polisz friends. The tournament was a minor disaster for me, but I enjoyed it nevertheless. Especially the moments not spent playing go.
</p>
<p>
While I’m not planning to break any more records as far as public transport is concerned, I still plan on trying to actively avoid using it. <a href="../walking-as-a-means-of-transport/index.html">Walking is good.</a>

It shouldn’t be much of a surprise to anyone that I used to watch (English) movies with Czech subtitles.
</p>
<p>
About two years ago I found out that it was a really bad idea. Apart from the subtitles stealing my time because I had to read them, they also stole my brain cycles as I <em>couldn’t avoid comparing what I heard in the English original to the Czech translation</em>, looking for what I missed and what I’d translate better. While this might have been a good exercise as far as translation skills are concerned, it made me tired rather quickly. Plus I usually had no idea what the movie was about.
</p>
<p>
So I switched to English subtitles. That was a great improvement. No more time spent translating everything both ways three times. I could finally enjoy movies again. But still, I couldn’t help but read the subtitles anyway, just <em>because they were there</em>.
</p>
<p>
And so it happened that I almost stopped using subtitles for English movies alltogether. I still occasionally use subtitles for special things such as Monty Python, where there are a lot of jokes and puns which would be difficult for me to catch otherwise.

Do I spend too much time at work?
</p>
<p>
Let’s see:
</p>
<p>
First, I work eight hours a day and I sleep eight hours. That means I work <em>half</em> of my waking time.
</p>
<p>
Second, I only work <em>two out of three</em> days (counting weekends, public vacations and paid holidays adds up pretty close to one third). This means that I spend one third of my waking time at work. Not too bad.
</p>
<p>
Third, I’ll probably work around <em>half of my life</em> (I didn’t work during my first 20 years here and I won’t work when I’m old either).
</p>
<p>
That means I am going to spend about <strong>one sixth of my life at work</strong> (awake life, that is). That definitely doesn’t feel like “too much”, does it?
</p>
<p>
Oh, plus I got some tesuji up my sleeve… but more on that next time. 8-)

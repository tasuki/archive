My name is David and you also may know as Master001. But now I am Sempai001 because I am goint to be superior over anyone who stands in my way until i get to a better level. I love go and if anyone ruins or disrespects the game they should be ashamed of themselves. Anyways I hope that I get to face all of you and I hope you find it a teaching and a fun experience because i am not weak anymore i am slowly getting up to a very high level so i hope this encourages you to play me, thank you for reading my profile notes and i look forward to playing you and showing why i am called Sempai001 because i will be very superior at go.

This is KGS info of a random player, the info of his other account mentions his ambitions to become a pro. While I find it all very entertaining for some reason (the reason might be that I just looked at the game he was playing and he played several non-working ladders and more than half of his stones were dead, a solid 30kyu), it also led me to some reflective thoughts. Ain’t I a bit like him? It’s the dangerous attitude: “hey look, I’m very high level”. Very high level 30kyu? What a joke. Very high level amateur 4dan? Pretty much the same…
</p>

The key to getting stronger is your ability to doubt. People who never doubt are never going to improve. When one very strong amateur (and I mean really strong, of professional strength) got asked why he was so strong, he replied: “I’m always surprised”. I think there’s something similar about it…

        <p><p>Writing blog posts around half past two during the night probably isn’t a good idea, but it sure is a good excuse if there are any silly things. :-P</p>

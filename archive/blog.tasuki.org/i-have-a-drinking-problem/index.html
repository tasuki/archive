I think I have a drinking problem.
</p>
<p>
During all of my life, it was enough for me to drink 4-5 glasses (slightly over a liter) a day. I was never thirsty and often had to force myself to even drink at all.
</p>
<p>
Recently, this has changed tremendously – I drink over 4 liters a day. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that I drink water almost exclusively. I used to drink a lot of sweet carbonated water, but now I can’t stand it. It leaves a very annoying aftertaste (funnily, I used to think exactly that about pure water). I am not sure when I started drinking water so much, but I think it was around last summer. I usually drink just tap water, and at work there are big canisters with water kind of similar to tap water.
</p>

</p>
<p>
Does anyone have any idea what could have been the cause of such a dramatic change in the amount of water (or liquid, if you prefer) I drink daily?

        <p><p>Could be due to increased mental activity. Your brain needs to rid itself of several waste products and drinking is the way to accomplish it. Actually this is not uncommon. I noticed this in many of my working friends. Try also some green tea. It’s health, reduced the prospects of prostate cancer and free radicals and other such things that tap water doesn’t. Incidentally you prolly read the digg article lately about (low doses of) all kinds of medicines being found in all kinds of drinking water.</p>

        <p><p>Dr. Google thinks you should read http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydration – or consult a doctor, if you’re worried.</p>

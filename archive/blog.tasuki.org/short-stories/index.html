Short stories are good when you don’t have much time but want to read something (why welcome, Captain Obvious).
</p>
<p>
Here are few that I really liked:<br />
<a href="http://www.multivax.com/last_question.html">Isaac Asimov: The Last Question</a><br />
<a href="http://www.terrybisson.com/meat.html">Terry Bisson: They’re Made out of Meat</a><br />
<a href="http://www.eastoftheweb.com/short-stories/UBooks/MoxoMast.shtml">Ambrose Bierce: Moxon’s Master</a><br />
<a href="http://poestories.com/text.php?file=pit">Edgar Allan Poe: The Pit and the Pendulum</a>
</p>
<p>
I strongly advise you to read at least the first two.
</p>
<p>
Somehow, I wasn’t that impressed by other short stories such as Nightfall (it wasn’t that bad, but somehow I expected the generally accepted best short story to be better, it was also longer than needed—the shorter the better) or An Occurence at Owl Creek Bridge.
</p>
<p>
And finally, I would like to ask for <em>your</em> advice. Do you know any really good (and possibly short) short stories?

        <p><p>The best short stories I know are stories written by Borges. There is no   clear difference between reality and fiction, it is smart and surprising…</p>

<p>I love for example “Babylonská knihovna “ and “kruhové zříceniny”</p>

<p>(sorry, don’t know the english name)</p>

I’ve been playing with (pdf)TeX lately, and I thought it might be a good thing (tm) to transfer some of the Project Gutenberg e-texts to pdf. So I did. And now what?
</p>
<p>
The <a  href="http://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a> website seems quite nice on the first sight… even on the second sight… the books are neatly organized and searchable and what not. Ok, now try to <em>actively</em> participate… Where’s their irc channel where I could ask questions? (they have none) Oh well, what about a usenet group or a web forum? Nothing like that, only a maillist (here I could include a long essay on why I hate maillists, let me skip it while just mentioning that maillists are generally unnavigatable).
</p>
<p>
Now I’m sick after having spent about an hour trying to find out how to submit the pdf files to Project Gutenberg. I learned all about how it should be formatted and what exactly I have to do and what I mustn’t do and all stuff I am not interested in. I have taken a .txt from Project Gutenberg, spent some time mostly playing with regular expressions and a bit of hand work (not everything can be done with regular expressions), and now I have a .pdf that I want to submit.
</p>
<p>
So… anyone knows how to submit it? I don’t and I’m not going to waste any more time searching for it. Later on, I might decide to publish the pdf’s elsewhere (prolly here).
</p>
<p>
Blah, lately I’ve been getting upset very easily… this morning, I responded to a hoax email that someone whom I don’t even know sent to about 200 people. I sent the response to all those 200 people and made it quite clear what I think about the sender. I think he deserved the public humiliation.

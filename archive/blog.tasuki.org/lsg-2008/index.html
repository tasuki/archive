“What took you so long?”
</p>
<p>
Yes, I’ve returned from LSG a week ago. But I spent all my time either at work or creating the <a href="../../gallery.tasuki.org/2008/07-LSG.html">photogallery</a> (I made over 800 pictures but my memory card got full so I had to delete the bad ones, I returned with over 650 pictures and the gallery is 187, so – as you can see – it was a lot of work).
</p>
<p>
LSG was great (you can see <a href="http://lsg.go.art.pl/index.php?site=linki">mroe photogalleries</a>), and I really regret having to wait almost 350 days for the next one again. Last year when I came home from LSG I just sat there for several days doing nothing and waiting for the next LSG. Luckily, this year work takes care of that, it’s really good to have something concrete to do.

Sorry for a boring post, hopefully it was at least short enough. :-) (and hey – it included links to photos… by the way, my favourite pictures from my own gallery are 4, 32, 94, 100, 109, 149, 152, 176, 178 and 181)

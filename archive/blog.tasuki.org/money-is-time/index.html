As any economist would tell you, time is money. What people sometimes fail to realise is that it works the other way around just as well: money is time.
</p>
<p>
That is, when you have time, you can work and get money. There are many things you can do with money. Most people just buy things they neither need nor want.

Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don’t need.<br />

<p>
Now, I mostly like my job. :) But this quote is still worth thinking about.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Advertising is the art of convincing people to spend money they don’t have for something they don’t need.<br />
<em>– Will Rogers</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
On a less serious but still related note…
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
By the way, if anyone here is in advertising or marketing… kill yourself…you’re the ruiner of all things good… you are Satan’s spawn, filling the world with bile and garbage… kill yourself.<br />
<em>– <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Bill_Hicks">Bill Hicks</a></em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
So much for quotes. Back to the topic.
</p>
<p>
I live in an abundance of luxury. I have food to eat, a warm and dry place to sleep, and clothes to wear. I’m not willing to submit to pointless consumerism.
</p>
<p>
That said, I am left with some money. I can leave it in the bank waiting for the economical crisis to eat it up. Or I can use it to buy some free time to do what I really want to do…
</p>
<p>
Happy New Year, by the way. :)

        <p><p>And indeed I will never understand why some of my colleagues, in addition to working 40 hours per week, have their on-call work time added to their paycheque, rather than having it deducted from the amount of time they need to work next month.</p>

<p>Last year I took some unpaid vacation time, I guess that’s what you’re planning to do as well? Or are you talking about paying people to do your laundry and clean your appartment? :)</p>

        <p><p>Ok, it isn’t really a secret – first is vacation time in Poland, and then I’ll be going The Netherlands for EGC. Hopefully, I will stay in NL after that (probably Amsterdam or thereabout).</p>

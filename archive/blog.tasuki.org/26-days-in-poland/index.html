I started the trip in Warsaw, where I came to participate in a tournament. I played against Seok-bin in the first round, and only lost by 7 points, which is probably my biggest go-achievement as of yet ;) In next two rounds I have beaten two 4d, and after that I lost to a 2d by half a point. That kinda sucked, but it still didn’t stop me from winning a 2gb <a  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipod_nano">iPod nano</a>. So overall, the tourney was a success for me. I’d also like to thank vertigo and the sushi girls.
</p>
<p>
The following day, Azael took me and spirit to <a  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Uprising_Museum">Warsaw Uprising Museum</a>. It presented the war in a very raw way, which was rather frightening but interesting to experience.
</p>
<p>
After that we (with spirit and Azael) moved to Lodz. We stayed there shortly so I’ve just seen the center of the city and Jewish cemetery, but overall it left a good impression on me.
</p>
<p>
I don’t feel like writing about LSG events chronologically, so here are a few things in more or less random order:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
During the first week, the weather was horrible, it mostly rained and it was damn cold. :/ The second week brought a significant change, so we could spend a lot of time by the lake (and in the lake). :)
</li>
<li>
I got drunk (vodka) to the point where I wasn’t able to walk or even stand up. :x This has never happened to me before, it is cool to <em><span style="font-style: italic">have</span></em> experienced it<em>.</em>
</li>
<li>
I won the main tournament at LSG (Memorial Jerzego Sacharzewicza) by winning 6 out of 6. I got lucky several times, including the win against Merlijn by half a point. I won the <strong>Haengma</strong> book and it got lost/stolen &gt;:-| (I know exactly on which table I left it and it just wasn’t there the next day).
</li>
<li>
The latest time at which I went to sleep was quarter to seven.
</li>
<li>
I might have smoked something illegal and I might have liked it. ;)
</li>
<li>
I’ve seen several people jumping full clothed into the cold lake late at night for just three beers. o_O
</li>
<li>
I played pairgo championship with a 24k and we beat a pair consisting of a 5k and a 1d. Pairgo sometimes really is unbelievable. :o
</li>
<li>
I experienced something which hurt me very deeply, but managed to recover in about three days. I’m getting close to becoming an emotionless robot. B)
</li>
<li>
Together with spirit and fiszu, we won the team tournament (handi -2, so it wasn’t that difficult for a strong team to win). I won Korean Fuseki book (the large red one).
</li>
<li>
I went on several walks with several different people during the night. Night walks (and night talks) for the win. Somehow people are much more sincere and there is a better atmosphere, at least that’s how I perceive it.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
My thanks to everyone who attended these events. Biggest thanks go to vertigo, Azael, Ela, Spirit, method, kotasza, Dorotka, fisz and soui.
</p>
<p>
PS: Photos so far: <a  href="http://kamille13.deviantart.com/gallery/">kamila</a> (great photos, but just a few), <a  href="http://kotasza.tasuki.org/konkurs/elesgie/">kotasza</a> (mobile photos: quality = 0, size = huge), <a  href="http://www.friends.hosted.pl/yapee/lsg2007/">sh/yapee</a> (many photos, good ones) and finally great photos by <a  href="http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/m.a.lukasiewicz/LetniaSzkoAGo2007">ignus</a>.
</p>
<p>
PPS: Oh yeah, in case you didn’t know: Spirit is totally <strong>NOT</strong> interested in underage girls. ;) :P ^^
</p>
<p>
PPPS: LSG 2008 starts in about 350 days, hope to see you there.

<p>But who could have guessed – there was a girl involved. ;)</p>

<p>The first thing is that it wasn’t just three beers! It was as many as three beers! :P
The second thing is that it wasn’t cold at all :)</p>

I won <a  href="http://www.littlegolem.net/jsp/tournament/tournament.jsp?trnid=amzn.ch.13.3.2">second division of third league of thirteenth amazon championship</a>. It really sucked hard, there was only one challenging game (with Cristi… I thought I was going to lose already), all others were pure pwnage. :licknose:
</p>
<p>
I had a look to see who is at the top of amazon rating list and what was my surprise when I saw myself in 16th place (that’s on the first page – yay) with just 1762. Kind of contrasts with my 17th place in twixt with 1947 (and I think I can play twixt helluva lot better than amazons…).
</p>
<p>
I also managed to luck out the second place in <a  href="http://www.littlegolem.net/jsp/tournament/tournament.jsp?trnid=gmk.ch.9.5.10">tenth division of fifth league of ninth gomoku championship</a> (with sonnenborn and some magic working to my advantage).
</p>
<p>
The Monster of Little Golem tournament isn’t exactly going my way. I have horrible positions in all the amazons games (against ~1500 players, whom I should beat easily) and it all seems just too much for me to handle… :(

        <p><p>heh, I thought I’d manage to advance but I don’t think so anymore… moreover there are games like LoA that I’ve never played yet, so I guess you can imagine the results :P</p>

I’m willing to pay money for a good service…
</p>
<p>
Example: I bought not too large amount of cheese for almost 20€ recently. At the shop, there was a cute girl who spent like 15 minutes helping me to choose what to buy. When I was interested in some cheese, I could try it out to see if I liked it. The cheese was like 5 times more expensive than your “usual” cheese, but it was excellent cheese and the service was just great.
</p>
<p>
But I don’t want to pay insane amounts of money for a very crappy service…
</p>
<p>
For example my bank. They send me all kinds of totally useless letters (snail-mail letters, even) all the time. But when I need to bring them a small piece of paper or they charge me 5€, there is complete silence, they just charge me 5€ without even telling me, hoping they’ll be able to do the same the next month. Also, I originally created the bank account to be able to withdraw my money from paypal and to buy things on the internet with the credit card. They gave me a card which doesn’t allow that (how should I have known?). A card that would enable me to do that would cost me 30€ a year. Also, it would enable the companies I buy things from to steal all my money from the account. What I need is a (possibly virtual) credit card that enables me to pay money through the internet when <span style="font-style: italic">I</span> allow it (yes, that’s actually possible, thanks to vertigo for telling me). But nope, this bank doesn’t have that, and they don’t know whether they ever will. Well, guess what, as soon as I find a bank that sucks a bit less (shouldn’t be much of a problem, anyway), I’m getting outta there. :/
</p>
<p>
Another good example of bad customer service is Czech railways. They’ll do anything to prevent you from learning when, how and for how much you can travel. I’m going to Vienna in about a week and it took me considerable time to find out that the return ticket Brno-Vienna costs 50€ (no wonder they are trying to hide that information as deep as possible). Surprisingly, going through Bratislava would be for about half the price (although Brno-Bratislava is about the same distance as Brno-Vienna, plus there’s the extra few dozens of kilometers for Bratislava-Vienna). But I’d have to change trains 2 times and considering the usual delays, there’s a chance that I’d miss my next train.
</p>
<p>
And for a change, a good customer service again: Student Agency buses. They are rather comfortable (I’d even dare to call them slightly luxurious) and take you from Brno to Vienna and back for 10€ (yup, that’s <span style="font-style: italic">five</span> times cheaper than the train). And if I had a better credit card, I could even buy my ticket on the internets…
</p>
<p>
To sum it up, big companies that charge a lot of money for nothing are driving me nucking futs.

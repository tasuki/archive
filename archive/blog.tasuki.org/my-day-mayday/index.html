It all started the previous night. I thought I should go to sleep early so I had a shower before midnight. Then I thought I’d read just a few pages of <a  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Gods">Small Gods</a> by <a  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Pratchett">Terry Pratchett</a> (thanks Merlijn :-)) and suddenly it was one o’clock. Well, time to sleep. But somehow my body didn’t agree, so I stayed awake untill half past two (that’s the last time I remember taking a peak at the clock).
</p>
<p>
Waking at six, five hours earlier than I am used to, and after only three and half hours of sleep, sucked hard. But I managed to get to the math lecture in time (2km walking, 10min tram, almost 1km walking). After the lecture I learned from the bulletin board that my next lecture started in 15 minutes and was in a place reachable in no less than 30 minutes (unless I’d have a car). I came half an hour late, but it didn’t really matter. The english teacher Ken is from Canada and he seems to be a very friendly and always happy person. I like happy people.
</p>
<p>
After this lecture I have to get back where the math lecture been… of course, I have 15 minutes for that (I’m getting used to it already). My impression from other lectures is that there are way too many windows machines and no other ones, but I always manage to break windows very quickly so I am not really afraid that much.
</p>
<p>
I took a walk back home, it’s slightly less than 6km long (at least judging from 55 minutes it took me) and it’s nice (add one point for every tree and substract one for every car, this one has positive value on almost any interval you choose).

Tomorrow I’ve got to be there at seven again. o_O

<p>A kde přesně vlastně? Soudě podle popisu a toho, že máš na sedmou, to vypadá na VUT. Jeden kámoš tam teď nastoupil do prváku a má naprosto pekelnej rozvrh – třikrát týdně na sedmou.</p>

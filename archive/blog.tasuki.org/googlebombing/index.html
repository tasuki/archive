Googlebombing is getting a certain webpage to the top results of google search just by anchor text in links to it (the page doesn’t have to contain the words (in fact when we talk about googlebomb it shouldn’t contain them at all)). The most well-known googlebomb is search for words <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=miserable+failure">miserable failure</a> returning biography of George W. Bush on the first place. Google <a  href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/09/googlebombing-failure.html">responded</a> to people who complained about this being unfair.

A friend of mine incidentally <a  href="http://www.google.com/search?q=operanda">googlebombed himself</a> with the word <a  href="http://hzik.com">operanda</a>. He accidentally put his “secret” nick into anchor text of a link to his homepage on a PR4 page (which is full of links so this one shouldn’t have much weight). This link alone was enough to make his homepage rank first out of about 600 results (even though all of them contain the word, some even multiple times).

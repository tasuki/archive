Getting them too?
</p>
<p>
It’s usually someone whose whole family was brutally killed and left several millions (or milliards) dollars. The person is in danger and has to transfer money to a safe place, you are the one to help him – you just have to send some kind of small fee like $80, well, who cares when you are to recieve several millions soon? ;-)
</p>
<p>
I stumbled upon a <a  href="http://www.newyorker.com/printables/fact/060515fa_fact">story of a psychotherapist who fell for the nigerian scam</a>. Well, simply put, he’s an idiot and I think he deserves what he got (now you might find this a bit harsh, but sending money to someone repeatedly without ever getting anything back seems pretty stupid to me).
</p>
<p>
There are actually quite a lot of people who enjoy pretending they are stupid and playing around with the scammers, some of them are pretty succesful in ridiculing the scammers and few even managed to get money from them (duh, some of the scammers must be real dumb if they let others scam ’em too). The <a  href="http://www.419eater.com/">419 eater</a> site collects the letters and various stuff, some of which is pretty funny (such as the guy who posed with a <a  href="http://www.419eater.com/images/oduobi_tokunbo3.jpg">loaf of bread on his head and bottle of wine in his mouth</a> (you can read the <a  href="http://www.419eater.com/html/oduobi_tokunbo.htm">whole story</a> too)).
</p>
<p>
Well, there is a lot of funny reading for long winter nights, scammers seem pretty active but so do scambaiters…

    <ul>
<li>
Almost got run over dozen of times. Surprisingly, on a bike it’s easier to keep left.
</li>
<li>
Stores are open (convenient; I’ve lived in a country where stores are closed).
</li>
<li>
In Sainsbury’s, everything is either discounted or 3 for the price of 2. You think people would see right through that, but I still get excited when whatever I want to buy turns out to be discounted.
</li>
<li>
Show me a white person in Sheffield and I’ll show you two Asians.
</li>
<li>
Local “pale ale” is actually very tasty.
</li>
<li>
Female cashiers twice your age call you “my love”.
</li>
<li>
Yesterday at a concert I met a guy from South England who couldn’t understand the Sheffield accent either.
</li>
<li>
Cheddar.
</li>
<li>
Hot girls are usually Asian. Or Spanish exchange students.
</li>
<li>
Full English breakfast is not bad. Though the beans take time getting used to.
</li>
<li>
Sheffield is hilly. Even though five speeds are all I need on my bike, sometimes I can’t help but secretly wish for a lower speed.
</li>
<li>
Ordered spicy pork noodle soup in an Asian place. It was the spicy-in, spicy-out kind.
</li>
<li>
There’s no light in my hotel bathroom but the pub downstairs is way cool.
</li>
<li>
Museums and galleries are plentiful and free.
</li>
<li>
Had to pack and move all my things three times in one week. Bought a pull-up bar and a bicycle to make the process more challenging.
</li>
<li>
Got called up on stage at a local theater play. Scared me so much that when asked where I was from, answered Argentina.
</li>
<li>
Peak district is awesome.
</li>
</ul>

Many people who have ever taught go have experienced it: someone comes and asks “is this move good or is that one better?”. You seriously don’t know but are pretty sure that the difference is not big, at least not on your level, even less on the level of the person who asked.
</p>
<p>
And you also notice that the person has made a totally catastrophical mistake just two moves ago. So you go ahead and tell them: “well, that move you had made before, it could have cost you 30 points”. But they <em>don’t give a fuck</em>, they just want to know the answer to their question.
</p>
<p>
You tell them that their question is irrelevant, that it doesn’t matter at their level, and that they had made a horrible mistake just before. They conclude that you are not strong enough to answer their question and go searching for someone stronger who could answer it…
</p>
<p>
A similar thing is someone not really strong showing a lot of rather deep variations very fast. They always make a horrible mistake around the second move, making all subsequent analysis useless. Yet they continue showing dozens and dozens of variations that have hundreds of mistakes…
</p>
<p>
These people can’t focus on the important things, they keep theorizing about things that are way beyond their ability and keep forgetting to keep their feet on the ground. I sincerely hope I’m not like that.

On thursday the signal got significantly worse compared to average, my connection speed was reduced about ten times. This kinda annoyed me, but I couldn’t do anything so I thought that waiting would do the trick. The other guy connected to the same wifi said that he had problems too, so we contacted the owner of the access point who told us that no changes were made. I waited two days, and then – another jump, this time to no connection at all. I contacted the guy on the other end of the wi-fi (aka owner of the acces point) again, he told me that he’s made no changes (again) and that the other guy’s problems already dissappeared. Well, so I had to examine my end. With immense help of my father (hey, I’m no hardware guy at all) we couldn’t find any problem anywhere. I was rather depressed (how can I survive without internet connection?), but after 8 hours or so the signal suddenly skyrocketed back to normal and I had my 3mbit again. This has lasted till now (which is like a day or so) and I hope there won’t be further problems. But it’s <strong>really</strong> strange, you know?

Good night.

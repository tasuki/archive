It shouldn’t be much of a surprise to anyone that I used to watch (English) movies with Czech subtitles.
</p>
<p>
About two years ago I found out that it was a really bad idea. Apart from the subtitles stealing my time because I had to read them, they also stole my brain cycles as I <em>couldn’t avoid comparing what I heard in the English original to the Czech translation</em>, looking for what I missed and what I’d translate better. While this might have been a good exercise as far as translation skills are concerned, it made me tired rather quickly. Plus I usually had no idea what the movie was about.
</p>
<p>
So I switched to English subtitles. That was a great improvement. No more time spent translating everything both ways three times. I could finally enjoy movies again. But still, I couldn’t help but read the subtitles anyway, just <em>because they were there</em>.
</p>
<p>
And so it happened that I almost stopped using subtitles for English movies alltogether. I still occasionally use subtitles for special things such as Monty Python, where there are a lot of jokes and puns which would be difficult for me to catch otherwise.

        <p><p>Could have been worse, actually. Yesterday I watched one of my favorite movies made by Ghibli – Laputa. It has been finally published in Poland not that long ago. I watched it with Polish subtitles turned on. It seems that the ``translation path’’ was (at best) Japanese -&gt; English -&gt; Polish. I understand that every language has its limitations, style, way of thinking and so on, but it’s a strange feeling, when you think: “The other people are watching a <i>different movie</i> (at times)!”, “Hey! She didn’t say <i>that</i>!” It’s a pity I haven’t made any notes – the examples I can think of right now are not even funny.</p>

        <p><p>Cascaded translations are <b>bad</b>. If it’s officially published it should definitely be translated <i>directly</i> from the original. And I fear even that is quite often rather distorted (either because the translator sucks or because it’s just impossible to translate).</p>

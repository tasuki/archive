As some of you might have noticed, I’ve been writing this blog in English exclusively. My “official reason” was for it to be accessible to more people. While I’m happy that more people can read my blog, it certainly wasn’t the main force behind my decision.
</p>
<p>
I spent my highschool days writing papers in Czech, and I always found it very difficult. For some reason, it never felt comfortable. Although Czech is my native language and I’m certainly much more proficient at it than at English, I definitely prefer English for writing any kind of prose (haven’t tried poetry yet ;)). I am not sure why I prefer English, but I think the language just suits my style of thinking better. The idioms are also quite different, and I like the English ones better.
</p>
<p>
Writing in English is a joy for me, while writing in Czech is a nightmare. Isn’t that enough of a reason?

        <p><p>Any moron can
Write haiku. Just stop at the
Seventeenth sylla</p>

<p>That one’s not mine, seen it on sensei’s (google says it’s elsewhere, too, so I dunno whom to credit with it).</p>

<p>Anyways, I don’t think I’m the right type of person to write (or even read ;)) poetry.</p>

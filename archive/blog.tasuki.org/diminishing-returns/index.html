    <p>There are many things which are vitally important to one’s overall wellbeing. Exercise, eating well, sleep, mental health, personal finance, and a few more.</p>

<p>There are people who concentrate a lot on one of these, eg they exercise a lot. Nothing wrong with exercise, but doing much beyond the bare minimum is high effort low payoff.</p>

<p>I try to do the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Tibetan_Rites">five tibetans</a> every morning. I only do seven repetitions of each, it takes about five minutes. The difference between doing nothing vs the five minutes of exercise is large. The difference between doing five minutes versus two hours, I won’t ever know but suspect it’s not so great.</p>

<p>Is the same true for blogging? This was not a high effort blog post. Just something I’d like not to forget.</p>

    <blockquote>
Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day<br />
You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way<br />
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town<br />
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
</p>
<p>
Tired of lying in the sunshine<br />
Staying home to watch the rain<br />
You are young and life is long<br />
And there is time to kill today<br />
And then one day you find<br />
Ten years have got behind you<br />
No one told you when to run<br />
You missed the starting gun
</p>
<p>
And you run, and you run to catch up with the sun, but it’s sinking<br />
Racing around to come up behind you again<br />
The sun is the same in a relative way, but you’re older<br />
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death
</p>
<p>
Every year is getting shorter<br />
Never seem to find the time<br />
Plans that either come to naught<br />
Or half a page of scribbled lines<br />
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way<br />
The time is gone<br />
The song is over<br />
Thought I’d something more to say
</p>
<p>
Home, home again<br />
I like to be here when I can<br />
And when I come home cold and tired<br />
It’s good to warm my bones beside the fire<br />
Far away across the field<br />
The tolling of the iron bell<br />
Calls the faithful to their knees<br />
To hear the softly spoken magic spells.
</p>

Probably my favourite Pink Floyd song. The lyrics are slightly related to certain events that happened in my life recently. ;)

I have <a  href="http://www.littlegolem.net/jsp/info/player_chart.jsp?gtid=twixt&plid=5460">finally reached rating 2000 in TwixT</a>, my second favorite game. Although I used to be in top ten with rating around 1950, I am not in top ten (12th currently) with 2000 now… the times are a-changin’…

<p>
On a less positive note, I am currently playing <a  href="http://www.littlegolem.net/jsp/tournament/tournament.jsp?trnid=twixt.ch.13.2.1">twixt.ch.13.2.1</a> (13th championship, second league), and I need to finish second. Which basically means beating passenger, with whom the game is <a  href="http://www.littlegolem.net/jsp/game/game.jsp?gid=605441&nmove=11">not looking really well after 11 moves</a>.

        <p><p>[…] My game against passenger, who will probably finish third, didn’t look very promising for me, as I mentioned in a previous post. It was after my move 11, his move 12 was a surprising and devastating mistake. Playing I13 instead, forcing my I12, would lead to a winning game for him. Of course, after J5, I13 no longer needs to be answered locally. Omitting this exchange practically gains white a very important move for connecting the right side string to the lower area. Fast forward to 22, that’s a pretty much forced exchange. I am not sure if my 23 is good, but I felt it would be enough. 24 should imho be played at K18 (kosumi, for those of you who know go  ). After that I can’t play H17 (because of L16), so I’m forced to follow I16, I19, E18 (I’ll leave the subsequent variations to the kind reader  ). After 24 it’s quite easy already, but overall I was pretty lucky that passenger missed 12.i13. […]</p>

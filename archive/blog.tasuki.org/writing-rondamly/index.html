While my spelling is generally good (it was always easier for me to remember how words are written than how they are pronounced) I always had troubles distinguishing vowels. I mean, I usually do know which vowel there should be, but I just sometimes make the mistake of writing a different one instead. I always realize it immediately when I see the word on screen, but somehow I don’t realize it when writing. So yeah, recently I’ve written ‘rondamly’ instead of ‘randomly’ in a chat and they thought it was a good joke… well, it actually wasn’t…
</p>
<p>
Sometimes I write a whole word differently, like writing ‘hojo’ instead of ‘toho’ (happened to me the other day). I don’t know the cause, and it’s not particularly annoying, it’s just strange and surprising.
</p>
<p>
I vaguely remember experiencing something a bit similar in some high school classes – I was very tired and trying to write what the teacher was saying, and as I was falling asleep, my hand somehow continued writing, although it didn’t write letters anymore, just random something that looked a bit like letters (and of course it had nothing to do what the teacher was saying as I was asleep by that time).
</p>
<p>
So it might actually be the same… you are still writing because of momentum while your brain already has a holiday…
</p>
<p>
Has anything similar ever happened to you?

        <p><p>I find it really interesting. Have you tried to decrypt what you’ve written in that half-sleep status? Of course, I do a lot of mistakes in typing, typically I switch the neighbouring letters, But that’s caused by lack of coordination in my fingers.  Btw. I like your site.</p>

        <p><p>It’s hard enough to try to decrypt what I write when I’m awoke, trying to read something I’ve written asleep is impossible. :licknose:</p>

<p>But well, it usually lasted only for 5-10 characters (then I either woke up or fell asleep completely).</p>

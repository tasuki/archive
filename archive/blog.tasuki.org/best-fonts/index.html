Fonts/typefaces are more part of our lifes than most of you think, they are virtually everywhere.
</p>
<p>
Today I was again deciding which fonts to use as my system fonts (on LCD), it is very difficult to choose wisely, so here are my top candidates: FreeSans (I like it), Arial (well, Micro<span class="math inline"><em>o</em><em>f</em><em>t</em><em>i</em><em>s</em><em>h</em>, <em>b</em><em>u</em><em>t</em><em>n</em><em>o</em><em>t</em><em>t</em><em>h</em><em>a</em><em>t</em><em>b</em><em>a</em><em>d</em>, <em>a</em><em>c</em><em>t</em><em>u</em><em>a</em><em>l</em><em>l</em><em>y</em><em>I</em><em>u</em><em>s</em><em>e</em><em>d</em><em>i</em><em>t</em><em>f</em><em>o</em><em>r</em><em>q</em><em>u</em><em>i</em><em>t</em><em>e</em><em>a</em><em>l</em><em>o</em><em>n</em><em>g</em><em>t</em><em>i</em><em>m</em><em>e</em>), <em>V</em><em>e</em><em>r</em><em>d</em><em>a</em><em>n</em><em>a</em>(<em>a</em><em>l</em><em>s</em><em>o</em><em>M</em></span>, takes quite a lot of space but reads very nicely) and Gentium. Let me say more about the last one, as I started to really like it:
</p>
<p>
<a  href="http://scripts.sil.org/Gentium">Gentium</a> is kind of half-serif font (not really serif and not really sans-serif) which is very nice to look at, it also renders well on my screen. It is rather dynamic yet very well readable, and there is a reason Gentium is called “typeface for nations” – there is almost any char you could think of. Well, in case that wasn’t enough, have a look at a screenshot:

</p>
<p>
Nice, ain’t it? So that’s what I use in almost all applications now as a default font.
</p>
<p>
Then I’d like to mention <a  href="http://www.is-vn.bg/hamster/jimmy-en.html">terminus</a>, that is <em>the</em> monospaced font. Suitable for day-long sessions in front of screen (believe me, I have tested it <strong>many</strong> times). I was very annoyed with Courier (New), Fixedsys and similar crappy fonts as their readability is awful. On the other hand terminus has wonderful readability and I got addicted to it very quickly. Here goes the screenshot:<a  href="http://www.is-vn.bg/hamster/jimmy-en.html"><br />

<p>
Oh yeah, and <a  href="http://www.vim.org">vim</a> rocks: no useless menus, only the info bar at the bottom… simple yet powerful :)
</p>
<p>
That’s about it, sorry for rather longish post (which should have been divided into two or three, I know) and for it being written in a hurry (working hard on a secret project ;-)).
</p>
<p>
PS: Some things I forgot: Terminus is a <strong>bitmap</strong> font, which is one of the reasons its readability is so good. It also contains all characters I need to use, and lastly, compare how mmmmm and iiiii has same width while it is both easy to read:

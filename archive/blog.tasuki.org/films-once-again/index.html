<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>A Fish Called Wanda</strong>, 1988, 8/10: It’s a comedy, a reasonably good one too. Undeniably Pythonesque.
</p>
<p>
<strong>A Hard Day’s Night</strong>, 1964, 7/10: Something between a comedy and a documentary. Maybe documenting a comedy.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Citizen Kane</strong>, 1941, 10/10: Classic, well worth watching (some people said that they expected too much and were disappointed afterwards; well, I don’t expect anything anymore (I still remember “expecting” before watching Pulp Fiction, no thank you), so I was more than satisfied).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Sling Blade</strong>, 1996, 10/10: Absolutely stunning film, wonderful atmosphere, great plot, and fitting end.
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Black Cat, White Cat</span>, 1998, 7/10: Romantic village comedy… a bit too many characters, but otherwise ok.
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Taxi Driver</span>, 1976, 3/10: The main problem here was that I couldn’t associate myself with the hero at all. After a while, I started actively hating him. It got a bit better when he had a good chance to bang a 12 year old girl and chose not to do so. The four points are solely for the ending, which was rather good (but the ordeal of the first three quarters of the film is not really worth it, me thinks).
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Seven Samurai</span>, 1954, 9/10: Great movie, many interesting ideas and good points. Moreover, the ending was just marvelous.

        <p><p>Posts older than 90 days have automatically disabled comments. It turned out to be the best way of combatting spam. I use Akismet (which is great), but while it catches 98% of spam, 2% get through. And I was receiving hell lot of spam on some of the older posts… Now I receive about 3 spams a week, which get caught by akismet most of the time…</p>

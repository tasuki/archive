I think I should create a category called “rant” in my blog.
</p>
<p>
I think you also read all those funny stories… Secretary: “I have a problem with Windows.” Support: “What do you have on your monitor?” Secretary: “A flowerpot.”
</p>
<p>
It’s funny as long as it happens to other people, but I get a lot of similar questions while admining on KGS, and believe me — it’s not funny, it’s just very very tiring. :|
</p>
<p>
The name has been changed to protect the guilty. There is a menu called “Rooms” on KGS, and right in this menu, there is a button called “Open Games”:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
leebark: I accindently exited out of open games! How do I get back?<br />
tasuki: Rooms &gt; Open games<br />
leebark: what catogory though?<br />
leebark: main?<br />
tasuki: no room list, no category<br />
tasuki: just click on “Rooms” :)<br />
leebark: I’ve clicked on rooms but it’s not there<br />
leebark: :.[<br />
tasuki: look carefully<br />
tasuki: it’s in the rooms menu here<br />
tasuki: not in the room list<br />
leebark: I got it<br />
leebark: thanks<br />
tasuki: great…
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
He didn’t even say hello or hi (I respond very reluctantly to users who ask stupid questions and don’t even bother to greet me). He asks me something he could find out by himself, and then fails to follow the directions I give him (he searched in Rooms &gt; Room List &gt; [Various Categories]). I had to repeat it <em>three times</em> for him to get it. :-/
</p>
<p>
The second one was even worse:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
tomoyuki: Please help me, how can I enroll the outcome?<br />
tasuki: go to http://eygml.tasuki.org/<br />
tasuki: log in<br />
tasuki: proceed to the league page<br />
tasuki: find the game in the table, click “sgf”<br />
tasuki: and upload the sgf file of that game<br />
tomoyuki: thank you<br />
[ half an hour of silence ]<br />
tasuki: so will you upload it? :-)<br />
tomoyuki: how can I upload my game?<br />
tomoyuki: from what?<br />
tasuki: the sgf file<br />
tasuki: you can download sgf of a game from kgs by right clicking on it in your gamelist<br />
tomoyuki: It says “The game should have been played between tomoyuki and VincentV but it was played between VincentV and Prodigious.” What can I do?<br />
tasuki: you should upload the game played between tomoyuki and VincentV, NOT the game between VincentV and Prodigious<br />
tasuki: each user can only upload their own games<br />
[ tomoyuki has logged out without uploading the game ]
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I think this requires no further explanation. I could upload the game for him, but am I expected to upload all the 250 games that we are going to play in the league? :S
</p>
<p>
I have enough of people complaining that the game uploading procedure is too difficult (it isn’t, it takes one click to choose which game to upload, one click to select the game file, and one click to actually upload it; could it be any easier?). I have enough of people using different KGS nicks than they chose in their profile (which they can edit anytime) and complaining that they can’t upload their game. I have enough of people writing their nickname in ALL CAPS once and in lower case the other day and being surprised (remember kids: Capitalization is the difference between “I had to help my uncle Jack off a horse.” and “I had to help my uncle jack off a horse.” (if you don’t know what the second one means, good for you)). Just choose one capitalization of your nickname/password and stick with it, mmkay? ^^
</p>
<p>
Simply put: I don’t enjoy providing free tech support for idiots in my free time. I enjoyed creating the EYGML site, I learned something and created something useful. I think I spent few dozens of hours doing that. Now it’s the users’ turn to do some work (the navigation is intuitive for most people, however, the few who don’t find it intuitive should first try it out, or try thinking, before asking me silly questions).

<p>
With love,<br />

Yay, I made it – one year without using Brno public transport. I walked, walked, walked and walked. Sometimes I used my bike when it was too far and when the weather was suitable. I only used car when it was because of someone else (such as driving my grandaunt to her home or similar occasions).
</p>
<p>
I had used public transport at Brno tournament one year ago, and now I had to do the same because the tournament site is too far to walk to and I couldn’t go by bike as I was going with my Polisz friends. The tournament was a minor disaster for me, but I enjoyed it nevertheless. Especially the moments not spent playing go.
</p>
<p>
While I’m not planning to break any more records as far as public transport is concerned, I still plan on trying to actively avoid using it. <a href="../walking-as-a-means-of-transport/index.html">Walking is good.</a>

And yes, j’aime français, why are you asking?

        <p><p>Well, you see… Brno is relatively small so it’s not <i>that</i> difficult (my work is something over 2km, train station about 3km). That said, when I was in Warsaw I of course walked from the train station to v’s place :-) (I hope you are who I think you are, cause otherwise this will be rather impossible to understand)</p>

        <p><p>Rather awesome thing :). Though in place where I live I also don’t use public transport and walk/bike all the time with one exception which is going to work (12km is really not a distance I would like to walk :D). And when I was in Brno because of teeth or Invex I always used to walk to the site from train/bus .. it is refreshing, gives time to think and is easy on ones budget (being a student can be really bad at times).</p>

        <p><p>szeery: good points…</p>

<p>There’s only one you forgot – it makes you remember the way. When I drive somewhere 5 times I can still forget where to take the turn and often I’m not exactly sure where I am etc. When I walk somewhere just two times (there and back), I’ll remember it forever and won’t get lost the next time.</p>
